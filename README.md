# sci_comp_materials

Welcome to the course materials for PHY 250L Computational Physics at W&J College.  These materials are from the Spring 2018 iteration of the course.

This course is designed to introduce science students to the basic ideas of scientific computation.  The course is intended specifically for students with no previous programming experience, though students with lots of non-scientific programming experience will learn quite a bit, too.

Each week's course materials are presented/contextualized by a short (20-minutes) interactive lecture.

The course begins with 7-ish weeks of instruction in python.  For this section of the course, student work through weekly tutorials in Jupyter notebooks in class, and complete a homework assignment (pdf) in either a Jupyter notebook or a stand-alone python program.  Most students do the latter using the Spyder IDE.

At around mid-term the course transitions to using MATLAB.  No good interactive MATLAB environment exists (to my knowledge).  Thus, students work through a set of tasks explained in course notes (pdf), and then complete a homework assignment (pdf) outside of class.
