    "\n",
    "Last time you learned and practiced some of the basics of programming and python syntax.  At this point, perhaps you think of python and your computer as a big, awkward calculator.  Be patient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week you learned basic operational syntax and variable declaration.  This is good if all you want to do is quick one-off calculations.  The really useful stuff from last week was loops and control structures: for loops, while loops, and if statements.  These allow you to tell your computer to do long, tedious calculations while you go off and have a cup of coffee or do some other enjoyable human thing. (Appreciate art?  Comprehend metaphors?  We're running out of human things to do...)\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you learned how to define a function.  Once a function is defined, it may be used anywhere in a program, usually inside of a loop, to automate repetitive, tedious calculations.  You'll get more practice with that soon.\n",

    "### II) Random number generation\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the breakthroughs that computing allowed scientists to make is progress in statistical sciences.  Generating large random or pseudo-random datasets to study is difficult.  In the old days, if I wanted to investigate the large-scale/statistical properties of something like a game of blackjack (you know, for cheating reasons), I had to actually *deal* many games of blackjack.  Ugh!  Gross.  That would take so much time!  With computers, I can generate millions of blackjack hands according to the deck properties and history with a bit of sly programming.  This hinges on a) the computer's ability to do loops and b) the computer's ability to generate random numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has modules for generating random numbers.  A *module* is a bit of code that python is able to use (almost like a book of extra knowledge), but that python doesn't pre-load without you telling it.  In order to have access to the built-in stuff in the random number generation module, we need to tell python to load it before we do any calculations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This process is analogous to the way that humans work.  Pretend that you and I are going on a camping trip on which we'll need to defend ourselves from bears.  You are perfectly capable of protecting us from bears, but you'll need to learn the skills before we go.  You *can* do it, you just don't know *how* yet.  SO!  Before we leave and start camping, I ask you to go to the library and read the book \"HOW TO DEFEND ONESELF FROM BEARS\" to load the knowledge into your brain/mind.  After you do that, I can call on you to execute many bear-defense strategies: stab, jump, bear headlock, play dead, etc.\n",

As you know, quantum processes are non-deterministic; the outcome of a measurement is randomly selected according to the probability density function, the absolute square of the wavefunction.
