I've already shown you how Mathemagica can do this *symbolically*, but sometimes the function to be integrated is too complicated to integrate symbolically, OR we don't really care what the functional form of the integral is (we just want a number).  This might sound really abstract, but if you've ever played (almost) any video game or watched any CGI film, the action that you've seen is based on numercal solutions of integration of differential equations, which is basically just another way to think about integrating.\n",
